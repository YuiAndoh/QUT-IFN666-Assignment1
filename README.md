# QUT-IFN666-Assignment1
This is my first assignment for IFN666 (Web and Mobile Application Development) at QUT.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
**This project is strictly for reference only.

## Step By Step

You can run the project by following the steps below in the project directory:

### `npm install`

This installs required modules for the project to run and creates node_modules folder in the project directory.

### `npm run json-server`

This project is using json-server to mock the server (as it originally used endpoints provided by the unit to access QUT server).<br />
This line establishes the mock server on port 3001.

### `npm start`

By opening another terminal and executing this, the app starts running in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
